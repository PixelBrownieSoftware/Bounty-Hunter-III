Beth: Oh hey! Uh - didn't see you there!
Peast: You ok?
Beth: S-sure sure! I just decided to take a walk and read this book here.
Peast: You know there are dangerous snakes out here right?
Beth: Um... um... well
Peast: I'll just leave you to that - I've got more important things to focus on.
[When interacted with again]
Beth is intensely focused on her book, whilst occasionally looking up. She might be up to something.

Peast: Didn't I just see you back there reading a book?
Beth: Didn't you say you had more important things to do?
Peast: Oh... yeah.
Beth: Then leave me alone, can't you mind your own buisness?
